NSLS-II-CSX Beamline "Issues"
=============================

This repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/NSLS-II-CSX/issues/issues)
is used for tracking progress on issues encountered on both CSX branches 23-ID-1
and 23-ID-2. These issues are not nessesaraly about software. They can be 
any beamline issue which needs attention. We can then track them using github tools. 

Please use the [wishlist](https://github.com/NSLS-II-CSX/wishlist) for tracking 
new and improved items for the beamline.
